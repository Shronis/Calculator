This is the calcualtor, the master branch is the last version of the program that worked, it has the CVS reader for only the add test. 
The CVS branch has the CVS reader for all the tests but it does not work. When it reads the files it keeps the information from one test
when performing another, as a result this causes the other tests to fail, I tried many different ways for the information to be deleted
after performing a test but it never worked and as a result I was unable to get it to work.
The file named "working" is a screenshot of the last time the program worked. The program has the functions for 
addition,subtraction,multiplication,division,Square and square root
