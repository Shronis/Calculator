This is the calcualtor, the master branch is the last version of the program that worked, it has the CVS reader for all the test functions of the 
calculator which are addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square, and square root. The CVS reader branch was just for getting the CVS reader
to work it is now the same as the master. The file nmaed "working" show a screenshot of the program working with all the CVS Readers
